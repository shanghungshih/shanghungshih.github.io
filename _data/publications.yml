  # desc: 'In this paper, we consider the problem of learning to simultaneously transfer across both environments (ENV) and tasks, probably more importantly, by learning from only sparse (ENV, TASK) pairs out of all the possible combinations. We propose a novel compositional neural network architecture which depicts a meta rule for composing policies from the environment and task embeddings.'

Our extensive empirical results show that in about 50\% of cases, jointly learning all 11 tasks improves either learning tasks independently or pairwise learning of tasks. We also show that pairwise MTL can inform us what tasks can benefit others or what tasks can be benefited if they are learned jointly. We additionally identify tasks that can always benefit others as well as tasks that can always be harmed by others.'
